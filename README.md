# Longest-increasing-subsequence-java
Implementation of longest increasing subsequence algorithm [enter link description here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence) in 2 variants - continous and non-continous.

This was the task I was asked as part of interview for algorithmic hedge fund.

**Warning**
Implementation is not based on above wiki page.
